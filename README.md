# NBA-Player-Performance-Prediction-A-Statistical-and-Machine-Learning-Approach

Project Overview
This project analyzes NBA player statistics to understand what factors influence scoring performance (Points Per Game). Using publicly available data from Basketball Reference and NBA Stats, it explores how variables like age, position, minutes played, and shooting accuracy affect a player’s performance. The analysis focuses on data visualization, correlation, and simple statistical methods to uncover meaningful insights about player efficiency and scoring patterns.
